## 📖 About the Book

This book is a collection of “missing guides” that help developers evolve from traditional coders into **AI Orchestrators**. Unlike generic AI tutorials, this book focuses on the **engineering discipline** required to build reliable systems with probabilistic tools.

### What's Inside?
It covers the full lifecycle of AI-augmented development:
- **Foundations:** Prompt Engineering, Context Management (RAG), and Agent Roles.
- **Quality:** Evaluation Engineering, Mutation Testing, and Feedback Loops.
- **Governance:** Ethics, Security, and "Human-in-the-Loop" protocols.
- **Strategy:** Multi-Agent Collaboration, ROI Metrics, and Future-Proofing.

### New in v1.1
- 🎯 **Learning Objectives** at the start of every chapter.
- ⚖️ **Trade-offs & Risks** sections (e.g., "The Cost of Autonomy") to ensure a balanced view.
- 🛠️ **Production-Ready Templates** for prompts and context.
- 📚 **Unified Glossary** of AI engineering terms.
